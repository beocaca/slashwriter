**Slashwriter** is a tool for creating, organizing, and sharing documents online. Its block-based collaborative editor, which is easy to use, is designed to help you create high-quality documents while saving you time.

Here's an overview of some of the features:

-   **Commands.** To add content to your document, you can use commands. By typing / in the editor, the list of commands appears. For example, /title allows you to add a title, and /bold allows you to make text bold.

-   **Block Editor.** The editor organizes your document into blocks: paragraphs, headings, images, tables, etc. By hovering over one of these blocks, the handle (â ¿) that appears allows you to drag and drop them to another part of the document.

-   **Embedded Documents.** To organize your documents, you can embed sub-documents within a document using the /document command. When a document becomes too long, moving the content of a section into embedded documents makes reading and navigation easier.

-   **Markdown.** The editor is compatible with markdown commands to make writing faster. For example, #, ##, and ### can be used to create titles and subheadings.

And many more...
